How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

 Using FC quickly showed the lines that had changed..

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   When updating large files, it will make it easier to identify changes and debug new code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can identify change revisions as needed.. and retain the old files if you need to back out a change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some files are interconnected and need to be tracked as a group while other files are independent

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can see the revision logs and compare the different files for relative changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control gives you a back out option if you induce a bug..

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to figure out how to use version control!!
